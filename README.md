# Chatbot Application Documentation

## Overview
This chatbot application is designed to provide interactive and intelligent responses to user queries. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) models for generating embeddings, retrieving relevant information, and facilitating seamless conversations. The application is built using Python and integrates several services and utilities for efficient functionality.

### Features
- **Interactive Chat**: Responds to user queries with contextual and relevant answers.
- **PDF Upload and Processing**: Users can upload PDF documents, and the chatbot can extract and retrieve information from them.
- **Embedding Service**: Converts text into embeddings for similarity calculations and retrieval tasks.
- **API Integration**: Exposes endpoints for chat and PDF-related operations.
- **Customizable Configurations**: Includes a configuration file for easy customization of settings.
